//Potential solutions:
// 1. Check for CSS Specificity Conflicts:
// Ensure that your Tailwind CSS classes have sufficient specificity to override other styles that may be interfering.
// 2. Purge unused CSS
//Make sure you are purging the unused CSS classes to avoid unexpected behavior
// 3. Verify Tailwind Configuration:
// Review your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that your content paths are correctly configured and that any plugins or customizations are working as expected.
// 4. Check for Conflicts with other CSS frameworks or libraries
// If using other frameworks or CSS libraries ensure they are correctly integrated with tailwind css.
// 5. Inspect browser's developer tools:
//Use the browser's developer tools to check if the classes are even added to the dom elements, if not check the steps above, if they are added check the css rules to determine why they are not being applied.
