# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply after the build process or in specific contexts.  The issue is not related to simple typos or incorrect class names.  Instead, it points to more nuanced problems such as unexpected CSS specificity conflicts, incorrect configuration, or interactions with other libraries or frameworks.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Build the project (the build process is project specific and is not included here).
4. Observe that certain Tailwind classes are not being applied to the elements they are assigned to.
